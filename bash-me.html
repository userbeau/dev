<p>Hi, my name is Beau and I am a Junior at CU majoring in TAM with a minor in
computer science. I enjoy riding my bike and eating fruits. In terms of
experience, I am familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript. I am interested in
 creative coding and interactivity. It would be fun to learn some stuff using
 the P5 javascript library.</p>
